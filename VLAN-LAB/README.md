# VLAN & Subnetting Lab â€“ Cisco Packet Tracer

This project involved the configuration of a fictional small office network using Cisco Packet tracer, focusing on VLAN segmentation, IP subnetting, and inter-VLAN routing through a router-on-a-stick setup.

##  Scenario Overview

I was tasked with designing and configuring the network for a small business with three departments:

- HR
- IT
- Sales

Furthermore, the company occupies two floors of an office building. Each floor has a switch, and departments are spread as follows:

- Floor 1: HR and IT
- Floor 2: Sales and IT

##  Topology Overview

- 3 VLANs (HR, IT, Sales)
- 1 Router, 2 Switches, and 9 PCs
- Router-on-a-Stick used for inter-VLAN routing
- /29 subnetting applied to each VLAN

| VLAN   | VLAN ID | Subnet            | Gateway IP       | 
|--------|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| HR     | 10      | 192.168.1.0/29    | 192.168.1.6      |
